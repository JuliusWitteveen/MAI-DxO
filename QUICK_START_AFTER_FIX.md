# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - UI Integration Fixed!

## What Was Fixed
The frontend was disconnected from the backend's rich diagnostic data. Now ALL diagnostic information flows to the UI in real-time.

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Start the Web Server
```bash
# Windows
run_webui.bat

# Or directly with Python
python -m webui.bootstrap
```

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000

### 3. Run a Test Case

#### Option A: Interactive Mode
1. Select "🧑‍⚕️ Interactive Mode"
2. Enter: "29-year-old woman with sore throat and peritonsillar swelling"
3. Click "Start Diagnostic Session"
4. **WATCH THE UI COME ALIVE:**
   - Agent icons will pulse as they think
   - Differential diagnosis list populates with probabilities
   - Cost counter increases with each test
   - Round counter shows progress
   - Click any agent to see their reasoning

#### Option B: Autonomous Demo
1. Select "🤖 Autonomous Demo"
2. Click "Load Demo Case" 
3. Click "Start Diagnostic Session"
4. Watch the complete diagnostic process unfold automatically

## 🎯 What to Look For

### Real-Time Updates (NEW!)
- **Agent Activity**: Watch icons animate when agents are processing
- **Diagnosis Evolution**: See probabilities change as evidence accumulates
- **Cost Tracking**: Budget indicator changes color (green→yellow→red)
- **Round Progress**: "Gathering evidence" → "Narrowing diagnosis" → "Finalizing"

### Interactive Features
- **Click Agent Icons**: View their latest reasoning
- **Hover Over Costs**: See breakdown of expenses
- **Watch Confidence Bars**: Visual probability indicators

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### During Diagnosis:
```
Round 1/10 | Cost: $300
🧠 Dr. Hypothesis [pulsing blue]
   ↓
Differential Diagnosis:
1. Peritonsillar abscess [████████░░] 80%
2. Lymphoma [████░░░░░░] 40%
   ↓
💰 Cost: $300 → $500 → $1,200
```

### After Completion:
```
Final Diagnosis: Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma
Accuracy Score: 4.5/5.0
Total Cost: $3,500
Iterations: 8
```

## 🔥 Key Improvements You'll Notice

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Static placeholder text | Live differential diagnosis |
| $0 budget display | Real-time cost tracking |
| Generic agent descriptions | Actual agent reasoning |
| No visual feedback | Animated status indicators |
| Missing round info | Progress tracking |

## 🎉 Success Indicators

If the fix worked properly, you should see:
1. ✅ Agent icons animating during processing
2. ✅ Diagnosis list updating with probabilities
3. ✅ Cost display incrementing with tests
4. ✅ Round counter advancing
5. ✅ Agent detail panel showing real content

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If UI still appears static:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check console** for WebSocket errors (F12)
3. **Verify API key** is set for your chosen model
4. **Restart server** if changes don't appear

## 📝 Notes
- The backend genuinely runs 8 AI physician agents
- Each agent makes real LLM API calls
- Costs reflect simulated medical test prices
- Interactive mode lets you act as the patient/clinician

---

**The UI is now fully connected!** The sophisticated multi-agent diagnostic system is no longer hidden behind a static facade - you can watch the entire diagnostic process unfold in real-time! 🎊
