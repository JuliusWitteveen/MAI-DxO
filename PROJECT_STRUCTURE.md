  - **📝 README.md**: The main README file for the project, providing an overview, key features, quick start guide, and other essential information.
  - **📄 requirements.txt**: A text file listing the Python packages required to run the project, including `loguru`, `swarms`, `pydantic`, `fastapi`, and `uvicorn`.
  - **🦇 run\_fixed.bat**: A Windows batch script for running the web UI with a fix that delays the import of the `mai_dx` module to prevent hanging or crashing issues on Windows.
  - **🦇 run\_webui.bat**: A Windows batch script that provides a quick way to start the MAI-DxO Web UI.
  - **🐍 simple\_test.py**: A minimal Python test script designed to identify what might be causing the application to hang by testing basic imports and the `mai_dx` module import.
  - **🐍 start\_fixed.py**: The fixed startup script for the MAI-DxO Web UI, which uses `server_fixed.py` to delay the import of `mai_dx` and avoid the Windows hanging issue.
  - **🦇 start\_server.bat**: A Windows batch script for quickly starting the web server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
  - **🐍 start\_webui.py**: A quick start Python script for the MAI-DxO Web UI that starts the server immediately without dependency checks and includes a fix for Windows compatibility issues.
  - **🐍 test\_server.py**: A minimal Python test script to check if the server can start correctly on Windows, including a compatibility fix.
  - **🐍 test\_setup.py**: A Python script that checks for the availability of API keys (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) and tests whether the `mai_dx` package can be imported successfully.
  - **🐍 test\_ui\_integration.py**: A Python test script to verify that the UI integration is working correctly by ensuring the frontend properly displays backend diagnostic data.
  - **📝 UI\_INTEGRATION\_SUMMARY.md**: A summary document detailing the implementation of fixes for the UI integration, including frontend message handling, backend message emission, and the overall data flow architecture.
  - **📁 .pytest\_cache/**: Directory containing cache files generated by the pytest testing framework.
  - **📁 .vscode/**: Directory containing Visual Studio Code editor settings.
  - **📁 agent\_workspace/**: Directory for agent-related files, such as error logs.
  - **📁 logs/**: Directory for generated log files.
  - **📁 mai\_dx/**: The main Python package for the MAI-DxO application.
    - **🐍 \_\_init\_\_.py**: Initializes the `mai_dx` Python package, making main components like `MaiDxOrchestrator` available for import.
    - **🐍 main.py**: The core logic of the MAI-DxO system, implementing the diagnostic orchestrator, the virtual physician agent panel, and the overall diagnostic process.
    - **🐍 test\_main.py**: A pytest script that tests the response parser in `main.py` to ensure it can handle the nested list format from the swarms agent.
    - **📁 \_\_pycache\_\_/**: Directory for Python's cached bytecode files.
  - **📁 webui/**: Directory containing files for the web-based user interface.
    - **📄 api\_keys.json**: Stores API keys provided by the user through the web interface.
